This was a coding challenge for a company I applied to.  I spent roughly a day working on it (8-10 hours total).

The biggest challenge was re-learning React (it had changed a lot since I previously used it, and I didn't have a lot of experience with it prior anyway) and a few design decisions (for example, whether I should store two boards per player - one for shots fired and one for shots taken - or just a shots taken board that the other player could ask for and get back the board with no ships, just shot results).
